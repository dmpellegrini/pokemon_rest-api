# Dannys Condensed Pokemon Rest API

This API sources its data from PokeAPI and retrieves choice data for the first 151 Pokemon.

If you would like to check out that API for yourself please refer to the link below

<!-- Link -->
[Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)

The PokeAPI is extremely comprehensive (which is great) but the amount of data can be overwhelming. 

This API aims to take choice pokedex information from that API


## How The Data Was Retrieved

All of the data was retrieved by calling the first 151 "pokemon-species" endpoints. 

For example if you wanted to get the first pokemon (bulbasaur) of the "pokemon-species" endpoint you would do the following...

https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/1

To populate this API, 151 calls were made to the PokeAPI database and all the raw data from those get requests was stored in a JSON file. Then some choice pieces of data were retrieved from that JSON file and stored sequentially in a MongoDB database.


## Data Provided

Below is the list of the data points provided with each Pokemon object. 

<!-- Unordered List -->
- name 
- pokedex number
- habitat
- previous evolutionary form 
- mythical status
- legendary status

There are plans to include more data in future versions of this API.


## Setting Up The API

```
node seed.js
```

5. Navigate to the root directory and run the server.js file with nodemon
```
nodemon server.js
```

6. Finally access the Mongo sever on your local machine with the following url in your choice we browser
